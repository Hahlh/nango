## API gotchas

- Depending on the region of the end-user account you are accessing, you will have to provide the region as an extension in the [connection configuration](/guides/oauth#connection-configuration). No matter whether you created your OAUth app in the EU or US, if you want to obtain the credentials of a user with an EU account, you will have to call: `nango.auth('zoho-books', '1', {params: { extension: 'eu' }})`. You can find all the available extensions [here](https://www.zoho.com/inventory/api/v1/introduction/#multidc).
- You can make your OAuth app cross-data-centers with [these instructions](https://www.zoho.com/inventory/api/v1/introduction/#multidc). This means that a single OAuth app will be able to query the Zoho API for Zoho accounts from the US, EU, etc.
