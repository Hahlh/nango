## Getting started

Gong offers both Basic auth (API key) and OAuth as authentication. For now Nango only implements Basic auth, see [this issue](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/issues/648) for OAuth support.

## API gotchas

- End users can generate API keys [on the Gong API page](https://app.gong.io/company/api). They must have the "technical administrator" user role to do this.
- Gong uses BASIC auth for their API, but doesn't call them username and password: `Access Key` is the username in Nango and `Access Key Secret` is the password in Nango.
- [Gong rate-limits](https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#overview) are per second and a total of 10k requests a day.
