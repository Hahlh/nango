## Triggering one-off syncs

This is especially useful if you e.g. changed the metadata for the connection and now want to re-import data.

### For all syncs of a connection
By default this triggers an additional, one-off sync run for all active sync scripts on the specified [Connection](/core-concepts#connections).

Leave the request body empty for this.

### For specific syncs
You can also trigger a one-off sync for a list of specific sync scripts.

Include the names of the sync scripts in the body:

```JSON
{
    "syncs": ["sync1", "sync2", "sync3"]
}
```
