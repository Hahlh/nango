## Update Connection Metadata

Use this API endpoint to update your [custom metadata](/guides/oauth#storing-custom-metadata-per-connection) for a Connection.

Nango uses the request body as the new metadata (it must be a JSON object). Note that this overrides any existing metadata.

## Fetching Connection Metadata

To read the existing metadata of a Connection simply [fetch it](/api-reference/connection/get). Your custom metadata is included as part of the returned Connection object.
