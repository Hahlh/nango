## Community Self-Hosting

Community Self-Hosting features have been designed with easy self-hostability in mind, ensuring that you can deploy them independently in your own environment.

These features are widely adopted by many companies in production. They simplify the process of obtaining, storing, and refreshing credentials to access any API. The same features are available for free without limitations on Nango Cloud.

## Enterprise Self-Hosting

The following features can be self-hosted but require our direct intervention, typically catered to Enterprise customers:
- [Syncs](/guides/sync)
- [Actions](/guides/actions)
- [Webhooks](/guides/webhooks)

Given their intricate nature and reliance on complex external dependencies, these features are readily available on our [Cloud](/cloud) or with Enterprise Self-Hosting. For those interested in a self-hosted solution with these features, please reach out on the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) to discuss our Enterprise offerings.
