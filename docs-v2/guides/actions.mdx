<Tip>
    Before using actions you need to setup auth by following the [Authorize APIs guide](/guides/oauth).
</Tip>

## When to use _actions_? 

_Actions_ encapsulate one-off synchronous workflows that involve external APIs: 
- write back information to an external API (e.g. update CRM contact field, ticket status)
- trigger external events in an external API (e.g. send email, Slack notification)
- fetch data synchronously from an external API (e.g. show a one-off list of user)

_Actions_ let you benefit from the advantages of the [Proxy](/guides/proxy), but allowing to encapsulate more complex logic (e.g. chained calls) in Nango scripts instead of in your code-base. With _actions_, you get:
- Credential-injection in requests
- Logging & monitoring
- Rate-limit handling
- Automated retries
- Pagination helpers
- Actions API

Actions can take in parameters and return data. They run synchronously, so you can use them for building your UI. 

<Tip>
Actions are also useful to handle the external API requests precending the establishment a [continuous background sync](/guides/sync), e.g. showing a field mapping UI to the user before storing the mapping in the [connection metadata](/guides/oauth#storing-custom-metadata-per-connection). 
</Tip>

# Step 1: Setup the Nango CLI & nango-integrations folder

Install the Nango CLI globally: 
```bash
npm install -g nango
```

Your Nango _actions_ live in your repo in a folder called `nango-integrations`. You can place this folder anywhere in your file tree, but we recommend you place it at the root level of your project.

In the folder where you want your integrations folder (e.g. root of your project), run:
```bash
nango init # Creates `./nango-integrations` with initial config
```

<Tip>
**Understanding the `nango-integrations` folder**

_Actions_ have two parts:
- A global config file called `nango.yaml` with _action_ names, return values, etc.
- A small typescript file per _action_, which defines the logic of the _action_

They all live in a folder called `nango-integrations` in your own code repository.

```txt nango-integrations structure
<YOUR-REPO>
    |
    nango-integrations
            |
            +- nango.yaml
            +- slack-notification-send.ts
            +- sendgrid-email-send.ts
            ...
```

Our CLI helps you manage this directory, create scaffolds, validates the configuration, etc.
</Tip>

Next, we need to authenticate the CLI. Add the following env vars (e.g. in an `.env` file in `./nango-integrations`):
```bash
NANGO_SECRET_KEY_PROD='<prod-secret-key>'
NANGO_SECRET_KEY_DEV='<dev-secret-key>'
```

Get your `prod` and `dev` secret keys from the [Project Settings tab](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings) (toggle between the `prod` and `dev` environment in the left nav bar).

# Step 2: Create an _action_

### Configure your _action_ in `nango.yaml`

Open the `nango.yaml` file inside the `nango-integrations` folder and inspect its field:
```yaml nango.yaml
integrations:
	slack-dev: # Integration name (must match an integration name in the Integrations tab of your Nango dashboard).
		slack-alert: # Arbitrary (unique) action name
            type: action
			returns:
				- SlackAlertResponse # Data model (defined below) as returned by your action script

models: 
	SlackAlertResponse: # Data model referenced above
        ok: boolean
```

<Tip>
	Possible model types include `string`, `boolean`, `number`, `date`, `null` as well as arrays & nested objects. Union types can be used with `|`.
    Model names must be singular as they are a single entity.

    A more complex example:
    ```yaml
    ExampleUser:
        project_id: string
        names: string[] # An array of strings
        number_of_cats: number
        completed: boolean
        emails:
            personal_email: string
            business_email: string | null
            other_emails: string[] | null
        created_at: date # Date is a full timestamp with both date & time
        modified_at: date
    ```
</Tip>

Nango uses the models you define in `nango.yaml` to provide type safety when:
- you write _action_ scripts
- you trigger _action_ scripts, passing in parameters and getting back a response

Multiple _actions_ can take in the same parameters and return the same responses, which lets you easily **create your own unified API** with standard data models tailored to your needs.

### Write your _action_

Modify the configuration of `nango.yaml` as you need and run (in `./nango-integrations`): 
```
nango generate
```

This will generate the scaffold for your _action_ script(s). Open any _action_ script (named `[action-name].ts`) which contains the following template (for the Slack example above): 

```typescript slack-alert.ts
import { NangoSync, SlackAlertResponse } from './models';

export default async function runAction(nango: NangoSync, input: any): Promise<SlackAlertResponse> {
	// Integration code goes here.
}
```
_Action_ scripts let you arbitrarly interact with external APIs. This logic is defined by you so that you can build arbitrarily custom and complex integrations.

<Tip>
Your _action_ scripts are deployed to Nango and automatically run on a schedule. Nango offers you multiple environments (dev & prod) to test & deploy your _actions_.

Because your scripts run in Nango's cloud, you cannot import additional modules (external or relative) in the _action_ scripts at the moment (we plan to resolve this limitation in the near future).
</Tip>

To develop _actions_ locally and test them run the following within `./nango-integrations`:
```bash
nango dev # Continuously watches integration files for changes.
```
Nango now watches your `nango-integrations` folder for changes and compiles the _action_ scripts & data models as needed. If there are any compilation errors (e.g. due to type issues) you can see them in the terminal where `nango dev` runs. 

Fill in the `runAction` method with your integration code:

```ts slack-alert.ts
import { NangoSync, SlackAlertResponse } from './models';

interface SlackAlertParams {
    channel: string
}

export default async function runAction(nango: NangoSync, input: SlackAlertParams): Promise<SlackAlertResponse> {
    const res = await nango.post({
        endpoint: '/api/chat.postMessage',
        params: {
            channel: input.channel,
            text: "Hello world :tada"
        }
    });

    return { ok: res.data.ok }
}
```

_Action_ scripts are called programmatically from your codebase, run synchronously and return the data specified in the `runAction` function.

<Tip>
To make API requests, use the proxy exposed by the `nango` object ([Proxy guide](/guides/proxy)).
    - `nango.get({})`
    - `nango.post({})`
    - etc

You do not need to specify the `providerConfigKey` and `connectionId` fields in the call to the Proxy. They are automatically injected (as well as credentials).
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use `await nango.log()` to log data from within integration scripts.
</Tip>

### Dry run your _action_

Before you deploy your _action_ to your cloud account you can test it locally to make sure it works as expected. You will probably use this a lot whilst developing your _action_.

Use the `dryrun` function of the CLI:

```bash
nango dryrun slack-alert test-connection-id --input '{"channel": "C02MPPQC8FK"}'
```

`dryrun ` will print the data as returned.

<Tip>
By default, the _connection_ ID is fetched from your `Dev` environment. You can fetch _connections_ from your `Prod` environment with the `-e prod` flag.
</Tip>

# Step 3: Deploy an _action_

**1. Deploy to the `Dev` environment**
    
    When your _action_ script is ready, you can deploy it to your `Dev` environment in Nango:

    ```bash
    nango deploy dev
    ```

    Inspect the [Syncs & Actions tab](https://app.nango.dev/syncs) to verify the deployment succeeded.

**2. Deploy to the `Prod` environment**
    
    Once you are ready to deploy to production, run:

    ```bash
    nango deploy prod
    ```

# Step 4: Trigger an action

_Actions_ are triggered explicitly and run synchronously, with the [backend SDK](/sdks) or the [REST API](/api-reference):

```ts
import { Nango }  from '@nangohq/node';
import type { SlackAlertResponse } from '<path-to-nango-integrations>/models'

const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<your-dev-secret-key>' });

const result: SlackAlertResponse = await nango.triggerAction({
    providerConfigKey: 'slack-dev',
    connectionId: 'test-connection-id',
    model: 'slack-alert',
    input: { channel: 'C02MPPQC8FK' }
});
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="cURL">

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.nango.dev/action/trigger \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <your-dev-secret-key>' \
  --header 'Connection-Id: test-connection-id' \
  --header 'Provider-Config-Key: test-connection-id' \
  --data '{ "action_name": "slack-alert", "input": { "channel": "C02MPPQC8FK" } }'
